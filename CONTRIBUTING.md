# Contributing to XTM Hub

Thank you for reading this documentation and considering making your contribution to the project. Any contribution that helps us improve the platform is valuable and much appreciated.

In order to help you understand the project, where we are heading and how you can contribute, below are several resources and answers.

Do not hesitate to shoot us an [email](mailto:contact@filigran.io) or join us on our [Slack channel](https://community.filigran.io). Most of the articles below are an introduction for our [detailed documentation](https://docs.hub.filigran.io/latest/).


## Why contribute?

[XTM Hub](https://filigran.io/solutions/xtm-hub/) is the **unified entry point** for Filigran's ecosystem.
It allows community members, prospects and customers to easily discover our offerings, access resources, and engage with one another (if you want to know more about XTM Hub, you can read the [detailed documentation](https://docs.hub.filigran.io/latest/)).

Whether you are an organisation or an individual working or studying in the field of cybersecurity and cyberdefense, or simply as an individual looking for a technical challenge, contributing to the XTM Hub project may represent a great opportunity for you.

* You will be able to adapt the tool to your core interests and methods of work by developing features or fixing bugs you are most interested in.


## Code of Conduct

XTM Hub has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the [full text](https://github.com/FiligranHQ/xtm-hub/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand which actions will and will not be tolerated.


## How can you contribute?

Any contribution is appreciated, and many don’t imply coding. Contributions can range from a suggestion for improving documentation, requesting a new feature, reporting a bug, to developing features or fixing bugs yourself.

For general suggestions or questions about the project or the documentation, you can open an issue on the repository with the label "question". We will answer as soon as possible. If you do not wish to publish on the repository, please see the section below [**"How can you get in touch for other questions?"**](#howcanyougetintouchforotherquestions).

* Just using XTM Hub and opening issues if everything is not working as expect will be a huge step forward. See our section about opening an issue. To report a bug, please refer to the [bug reporting module](https://github.com/FiligranHQ/xtm-hub/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). To suggest a new feature, please fill in the feature request [form](https://github.com/FiligranHQ/xtm-hub/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

* Don’t hesitate to flag us an issue with the documentation or the templates if you find them incomplete or not clear enough. You can do that either by opening a [bug report](https://github.com/FiligranHQ/xtm-hub/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) or by sending us a message on our [Slack channel](https://community.filigran.io).

* You can look through opened issues and help triage them (ask for more information, suggest workarounds, suggest label, flag issues etc.)

* If you are interested in contributing to the development of XTM Hub, please refer to the [detailed documentation](https://docs.hub.filigran.io/latest/). You can either fix an issue that is meaningful to you or develop a feature requested by others.

* All commits messages must be formatted as: `[package] <type>(<scope>): Message (#issueNumber)`.

**Allowed types:**
 * feat: for new features
 * fix: for bug fixes
 * docs: for documentation changes
 * refactor: for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
 * chore: for maintenance commits like tooling or config
 * test: for adding or refactoring tests

**Packages :**
 * backend
 * frontend
 * doc

**Scope is optional and should be a component in the package**

**Examples:**
* [frontend] feat(custom dashboards): add card component (#123)
* [backend] fix(login): handle missing auth token (#456)
* [docs] docs: update README with installation steps (#789)
