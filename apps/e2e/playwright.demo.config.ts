 * Config dedicated to recording demo videos against the local stack.
 * Reuses the base config (webServer, setup/teardown projects, baseURL) but:
 *  - always records video, regardless of pass/fail
 *  - runs headed and slowed down so the recording is easy to follow
 *  - disables retries/parallelism noise that would clutter the video output
 *
 * Usage: yarn test:e2e:demo tests/tests_files/demo/<spec>.spec.ts
